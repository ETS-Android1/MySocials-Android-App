# MySocials-Android-App
This app is inspired by Linktree and has the same concept. It links all my socials and works at one single place.
I made this app to practice and learn about different layouts in Android as well as multi page application.<br>
The app is now complete , I have integrated a web view in a separate activity making it a multy screen app and used both Explicit and Implicit Intents. Also added a scroll view for better compatibility.

To Try out the app , download just the SidsSocials.apk file and install in your android device : )

This work comes under the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.
